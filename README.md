## About the App

TravelApp is an application that allows you to search for you dream vacation. Our app provides a picture of you destination, average flight costs, information about your destination, along with the top tourist attraction!
If none of our included vacation spots catch your attention, you can always delete them from your list and manually add you own.

Day 4: next we wanted to start creating basic functionality to our fron end to display our data (CRUD).
Day 5: we wrapped up our front end with all our components.
Day 6: we made sure our app was functinal and depoloyed anf front and back.
Day 7: we wrapped up all the little inperfections and prepared for our presentation.
